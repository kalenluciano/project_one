### **_Description_**

This is an in-browser version of the game Snake. In the game, the user controls a "snake" block on a bordered grid and attempts to collect items by running into them with the head of the snake block. As the user collects items, they earn points and the snake grows behind itself, leaving a longer tail in its path. The user loses when the snake runs into the border or itself.

### **_Credits_**

A [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/reTJzqZO/ee88493ce0669b57fdd76c8c504e1cde/project-one) was used to keep track of development progress.

This Stack Overflow [article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2264072/detect-a-finger-swipe-through-javascript-on-the-iphone-and-android) served as inspiration for the swiping feature available on mobile devices.
